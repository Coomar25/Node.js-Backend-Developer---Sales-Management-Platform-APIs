## API Token Authentication
To access protected API endpoints, you need to include a token in the following format:

Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Ikt1bWFyIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg4NTMwNDkxLCJleHAiOjE2ODg1MzEzOTF9.u-Fb4XdZ802vPpw9de5YO2aXET9vhRKO0vy2CEjW2uA

Make sure to include the word "Bearer" followed by a space before the token. The token should be placed in the Authorization header of your API request.

When making a request to an API endpoint that requires authentication, include the above Authorization header in your request. The server will validate the token's authenticity and permissions. If the token is valid and not expired, you will be granted access to the protected resources or operations.

Remember to replace the example token with the actual token provided to you for authentication.

For more information on how to use API token authentication and the specific endpoints that require authentication, please refer to the API documentation or contact the API provider.

Feel free to modify and format this information as needed to fit your README.md file.
